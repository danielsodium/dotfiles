# Danielsodium's Dotfiles

My configuration files. There's a good chance this won't work on anyone else's machine as it doesn't work on my machine half the time.

## My Setup
- OS: EndeavourOS
    - I use this primarily because I'm used to Arch but I don't like having to figure out what is wrong with my nvidia drivers once a week, nvidia-inst is so nice
- WM: Sway
- Desktop Bar: Sway Bar
    - Why waybar when swaybar do trick?
- Launcher: Rofi
- Terminal: Foot
- Editor: Neovim 
    - Config created using kickstart and TJ DeVries' Advent of Neovim series
